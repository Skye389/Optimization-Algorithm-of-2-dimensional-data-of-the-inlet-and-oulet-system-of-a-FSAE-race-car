# Optimization-Algorithm-of-2-dimensional-data-of-the-inlet-and-oulet-system-of-a-FSAE-race-car
The objective of this project is to optimize the two-dimensional data of the intake and exhaust systems of the CF 700 engine (intake manifold 1 length, intake manifold 2 length, resonator volume, exhaust manifold 1 length, exhaust manifold 2 length), aiming to maximize the average torque across the entire operating range (2000–9000 rpm),
Before running the project, run: pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib deap joblib openpyxl in the cmd to download all the necessary libraries used in this project
